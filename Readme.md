This repository contains original code and model parameters to reproduce the simulations described in our work investigating and modeling the 3D structure of the human SOX9 domain in embryonic stem cells and cranial neural crest cells.  


To run, this code requires the polychrom repository, available at https://github.com/open2c/polychrom
